/* Protocols.
 *
 * A "protocol" is an OpenFlow version plus, for some OpenFlow versions,
 * a bit extra about the flow match format in use.
 *
 * These are arranged from most portable to least portable, or alternatively
 * from least powerful to most powerful.  Protocols earlier on the list are
 * more likely to be understood for the purpose of making requests, but
 * protocol later on the list are more likely to accurately describe a flow
 * within a switch.
 *
 * On any given OpenFlow connection, a single protocol is in effect at any
 * given time.  These values use separate bits only because that makes it easy
 * to test whether a particular protocol is within a given set of protocols and
 * to implement set union and intersection.
